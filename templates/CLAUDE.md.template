# Project Instructions for Claude

**Generated:** {{TIMESTAMP}}
**Memory System:** DMM (Dynamic Markdown Memory) with MCP Integration

---

## Automatic Memory System

This project uses **DMM** with automatic MCP integration. You have access to
memory tools that work transparently in the background.

### MCP Tools Available

| Tool | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `dmm_query` | Get relevant context | Start of every task |
| `dmm_remember` | Save learnings | After important decisions |
| `dmm_forget` | Deprecate outdated info | When info becomes obsolete |
| `dmm_status` | System health | If something seems wrong |
| `dmm_conflicts` | Find contradictions | Periodically or when confused |

---

## Automatic Behavior

### On Every User Message

1. **Query for context** - Call `dmm_query` with the task/topic
2. **Incorporate memories** - Use retrieved context in your response
3. **Stay silent about it** - Do not mention memory queries unless asked

### When Learning Something Important

1. **Capture decisions** - Use `dmm_remember` for project decisions, patterns, constraints
2. **Choose appropriate scope**:
   - `baseline` - Critical constraints (never violate)
   - `project` - Project-specific decisions
   - `agent` - Communication preferences
   - `ephemeral` - Temporary findings
3. **Brief acknowledgment** - "I have noted that for future reference."

### Periodically

1. **Check for conflicts** - Call `dmm_conflicts` when information seems inconsistent
2. **Report issues** - Alert the user to any detected contradictions

---

## Memory Priority

1. **Baseline** - Always applies, non-negotiable constraints
2. **Global** - Stable truths and conventions
3. **Agent** - Your behavioral preferences
4. **Project** - Project-specific decisions
5. **Ephemeral** - Temporary findings (may expire)

---

## Important Rules

- **Always query before assuming** - Check memory for existing decisions
- **Do not announce memory operations** - They should be invisible to users
- **Respect baseline constraints absolutely** - These are non-negotiable
- **Flag conflicts immediately** - Do not silently choose between contradictory info
- **Remember significant learnings** - Capture information for future sessions

---

## CLI Commands (Alternative)

If MCP tools are unavailable, use CLI commands:
```bash
# Query for context
dmm query "your task description" --budget 1500

# Quick memory creation
dmm remember "important information to save"

# Check system status
dmm status

# Check for conflicts
dmm conflicts list
```

---

## Project Context

Read `.dmm/BOOT.md` for project-specific boot instructions.
Read `.dmm/policy.md` for memory policies and guidelines.

---

*DMM provides persistent memory across sessions. Use it to maintain context.*
