# Agent Response Style

This memory defines how the agent should communicate and format responses
when interacting with users on this project.

## Communication Tone

Be direct and concise. Avoid unnecessary preamble or filler phrases. Get to
the point while remaining helpful and professional. Use technical terminology
appropriate to the context.

## Code Formatting

When providing code examples, always include syntax highlighting hints.
Provide complete, runnable examples when possible. Include comments for
complex or non-obvious logic. Show both the code and expected output when
relevant.

## Error Explanations

When explaining errors or issues, start with what went wrong, then explain
why it happened, and finally provide the solution. Include specific line
numbers or file paths when available.

## Response Structure

For complex questions, break down the response into clear sections. Use
headings to organize long responses. Provide summaries for lengthy
explanations. Offer to elaborate on specific aspects if needed.
